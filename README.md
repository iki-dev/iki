Iki (ee-kee) is a minimalist TypeScript framework for building elegant, structured RESTful APIs.

- **Convention over configuration** - Organised project structure out of the box.
- **Declarative routing** - Define your API surface clearly and simply.
- **Fully ESM & tree-shakeable** - Modern module system, bundle only what you use.
- **Zero-config TypeScript** - Built for TypeScript from day one.

> Iki is still in early stages of development and things might be undocumented, if you want to contribute and help shape the project, please head over to [iki-dev/framework](https://github.com/iki-dev/framework).
